A basic Android app inspired by the [Now In Android](https://github.com/android/nowinandroid) app, set up step by step with:

- UI: Jetpack Compose
- DI: kotlin-inject (with KSP)
- Navigation: navigation-compose
- Network: Ktor
- Persistence: DataStore and SqlDelight (with coroutines)
- Serialization: Kotlin Serialization
- Tests: Robolectric
- Modularization using conventions in `buildSrc`. TODO: Migrate to `build-logic`
